      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was born in Liverpool, England in 1970 when the mean global CO₂ concentration was 325.68 ± 0.12 ppm. I studied pure &amp;amp; applied physics at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) and graduated with a BSc (I:hons) in 1992. I obtained a PhD in applied mathematics in 1996 from the Mathematics Institute of Saint Andrews University, Scotland. I have 15 years postgraduate research experience in the fields of Earth observation and remote sensing. I am currently a member of the European Geosciences Union and the Royal Statistical Society and am doing a postdoc in the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading where I work for the Horizon 2020 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fiduceo.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FIDUCEO project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
