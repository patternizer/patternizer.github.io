  abstract = {To accurately determine multi-centennial trends in climate data records of the Earth's surface temperature, measurements are commonly analysed in the form of anomalies relative to a climatological reference period such as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) 1961–1990 baseline. One of many climate-monitoring challenges is that weather records of land surface temperature can be short, typically of the order of several years or decades, and often do not sufficiently overlap the reference period to allow calculation of the climatological normals needed to convert the observations to anomalies. Moreover, the volume of records of this type is increasing due to the rescue of early (pre-baseline) instrumental paper-based records and the growing prevalence of newer (post-baseline) weather stations. To address this, we apply a method to estimate the climatological normal for each calendar month of temperature time series that do not have sufficient data during the baseline period, using an approximation to local expectation kriging with station holdout (LEK). This exploits the information in neighbouring time series to estimate the expected mean level of short series of observations. We apply the method to a global database of monthly land air temperature at 11865 stations based on CRUTEM5 but with the acquisition of an additional 1233 station series including some that extend back to 1781, and with mid-latitude stations adjusted for exposure bias arising from the transition to Stevenson screens. We evaluate the LEK-based normals using climatological normals calculated directly from the station observations. Using this method, we obtain estimated normals for 2699 stations that did not previously have normals and we improve the estimated normals for a further 2611 which had previously been estimated from incomplete data. Finally, we demonstrate how incorporating these thousands of previously unused station observation fragments affects hemispheric temperature averages. Pre-1850 data—primarily from Europe—show a modest warming trend but pronounced multidecadal variability that is greater than after 1850. The additional stations improve spatial coverage by a few percent in recent decades and raise pre-1860 Northern Hemisphere temperature estimates by approximately 0.1°C.},

This data set, called the GloSAT reference analysis, has two novel features: it uses marine air temperature observations rather than the sea surface temperature measurements typically used by pre-existing data sets, and it extends further into the past than existing merged land and ocean instrumental temperature records which typically estimate temperature changes from the mid-to-late 19th century onwards. New estimates of diurnal heating biases in marine air temperatures have enabled the use of daytime observations, extending the dataset further into the past compared to nighttime-only marine air temperature data. The data set uses an extended version of the CRUTEM5 station database over land areas, incorporating newly available bias adjustments for non-standard thermometer enclosures used prior to the adoption of Stevenson screens and new climatological normal estimates for stations with limited data in the 1961\&ndash;1990 baseline period. Land and marine temperature anomalies are combined to produce a gridded data set following the methods developed for HadCRUT5. The GloSAT global and hemispheric temperature anomaly series show close agreement with those based on sea-surface temperature for much of the overlapping period of their records but with slightly less warming overall.\textless/p\textgreater},

  abstract = {Exposure biases are a pervasive non-climatic change in land air temperature records which have been introduced as a result of changes in the way thermometers were sheltered from solar radiation and the elements over time. Exposure biases have not been widely accounted for in observational records, due to difficulties detecting/correcting the bias using traditional homogenisation techniques; therefore, exposure biases still contribute significant uncertainty to the early period in global temperature compilations. Here, an empirical approach to address the bias arising from the introduction of Stevenson-type screens from the late-19th century is presented. The approach consists of: (1) an empirical analysis of 54 parallel measurement series to identify the characteristics of the exposure bias in four exposure classes; (2) the development of bias-estimation models based on an analysis of which variables influence the bias; and (3) the application of the models to an extended version of CRUTEM5 (CRUTEM5\_ext), based on exposure metadata, to quantify and reduce the bias. Step one identified differences between the temperatures recorded in Stevenson screens and early exposures, which vary seasonally, diurnally, and with location and exposure class. The largest biases (in mean temperatures) were found in freestanding exposures (up to −0.78°C annually) and in summer, while the smallest biases were generally found in wall-mounted exposures (near-0°C annually) and in winter. Significant relationships between the bias and temperature, downward top of atmosphere and/or received shortwave downward solar radiation were found in each exposure class and led to the development of three regression-based bias-estimation models. Application of these models to 1,960 mid-latitude stations in CRUTEM5\_ext, resulted in small (≤0.016°C) positive adjustments to the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude mean before 1880, and larger (≤−0.1°C) negative adjustments to the Northern and Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude means between 1882–1934 and 1856–1900, respectively. Larger adjustments were estimated regionally: up to −0.57°C annually and −0.79°C seasonally in individual grid cells.},

  abstract = {Methods for estimating the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations have been developed but have not yet been able to effectively include spatial correlation. We report on the development of a spatial back-propagation neural network (S-BPNN) model designed specifically to make such correlations implicit by incorporating a spatial lag variable (SLV) as a virtual input variable. The S-BPNN fits the nonlinear relationship between ground-based air quality monitoring station measurements of PM2.5, satellite observations of aerosol optical depth, meteorological synoptic conditions data and emissions data that include auxiliary geographical parameters such as land use, normalized difference vegetation index, elevation, and population density. We trained and validated the S-BPNN for both yearly and seasonal mean PM2.5 concentrations. In addition, principal components analysis was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data and a grid of neural network models was run to optimize the model design. The S-BPNN was cross-validated against an analogous but SLV-free BPNN model using the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean squared error (RMSE) as statistical measures of goodness of fit. The inclusion of the SLV led to demonstrably superior performance of the S-BPNN over the BPNN with R2 values increasing from 0.80 to 0.89 and with the RMSE decreasing from 8.1 to 5.8 μg/m3. The yearly mean PM2.5 concentration in China during the study period was found to be 41.8 μg/m3 and the model estimated spatial distribution was found to exceed Level 2 of the China Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) enacted in 2012 (\textgreater35 μg/m3) in more than 70\% of the Chinese territory. The inclusion of spatial correlation upgrades the performance of conventional BPNN models and provides a more accurate estimation of PM2.5 concentrations for air quality monitoring.},

  abstract = {Decision makers need accessible robust evidence to introduce new policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. There is an increasing amount of environmental information available to policy makers concerning observations and trends relating to the climate. However, this data is hosted across a multitude of websites often with inconsistent metadata and sparse information relating to the quality, accuracy and validity of the data. Subsequently, the task of comparing datasets to decide which is the most appropriate for a certain purpose is very complex and often infeasible. In support of the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) mission to provide authoritative information about the past, present and future climate in Europe and the rest of the world, each dataset to be provided through this service must undergo an evaluation of its climate relevance and scientific quality to help with data comparisons. This paper presents the framework for Evaluation and Quality Control (EQC) of climate data products derived from satellite and in situ observations to be catalogued within the C3S Climate Data Store (CDS). The EQC framework will be implemented by C3S as part of their operational quality assurance programme. It builds on past and present international investment in Quality Assurance for Earth Observation initiatives, extensive user requirements gathering exercises, as well as a broad evaluation of over 250 data products and a more in-depth evaluation of a selection of 24 individual data products derived from satellite and in situ observations across the land, ocean and atmosphere Essential Climate Variable (ECV) domains. A prototype Content Management System (CMS) to facilitate the process of collating, evaluating and presenting the quality aspects and status of each data product to data users is also described. The development of the EQC framework has highlighted cross-domain as well as ECV specific science knowledge gaps in relation to addressing the quality of climate data sets derived from satellite and in situ observations. We discuss 10 common priority science knowledge gaps that will require further research investment to ensure all quality aspects of climate data sets can be ascertained and provide users with the range of information necessary to confidently select relevant products for their specific application.},

  abstract = {This study estimates the impact of dust aerosols on surface solar radiation and solar energy in Egypt based on Earth Observation (EO) related techniques. For this purpose, we exploited the synergy of monthly mean and daily post processed satellite remote sensing observations from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations utilizing machine learning, in conjunction with 1-day forecasts from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). As cloudy conditions in this region are rare, aerosols in particular dust, are the most common sources of solar irradiance attenuation, causing performance issues in the photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) plant installations. The proposed EO-based methodology is based on the solar energy nowcasting system (SENSE) that quantifies the impact of aerosol and dust on solar energy potential by using the aerosol optical depth (AOD) in terms of climatological values and day-to-day monitoring and forecasting variability from MODIS and CAMS, respectively. The forecast accuracy was evaluated at various locations in Egypt with substantial PV and CSP capacity installed and found to be within 5–12\% of that obtained from the satellite observations, highlighting the ability to use such modelling approaches for solar energy management and planning (M\&P). Particulate matter resulted in attenuation by up to 64–107 kWh/m2 for global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and 192–329 kWh/m2 for direct normal irradiance (DNI) annually. This energy reduction is climatologically distributed between 0.7\% and 12.9\% in GHI and 2.9\% to 41\% in DNI with the maximum values observed in spring following the frequent dust activity of Khamaseen. Under extreme dust conditions the AOD is able to exceed 3.5 resulting in daily energy losses of more than 4 kWh/m2 for a 10 MW system. Such reductions are able to cause financial losses that exceed the daily revenue values. This work aims to show EO capabilities and techniques to be incorporated and utilized in solar energy studies and applications in sun-privileged locations with permanent aerosol sources such as Egypt.},

In the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, a Yankee Environmental System UVB-1 radiometer measures the erythemal dose rates every minute, and a Norsk Institutt for Luftforskning (NILU) multi-filter radiometer provides multi-filter based irradiances that were used to derive erythemal dose rates for the period 2005–2014. Both these datasets were independently validated against collocated UV irradiance spectra from a Brewer MkIII spectrophotometer. Cloud detection was performed based on measurements of the global horizontal radiation from a Kipp \& Zonen pyranometer and from NILU measurements in the visible range. The satellite versus ground observation validation was performed taking into account the effect of temporal averaging, limitations related to OMI quality control criteria, cloud conditions, the solar zenith angle and atmospheric aerosol loading. Aerosol optical depth was also retrieved using a collocated CIMEL sunphotometer in order to assess its impact on the comparisons. The effect of total ozone columns satellite versus ground-based differences on the erythemal dose comparisons was also investigated. Since most of the public awareness alerts are based on UV Index (UVI) classifications, an analysis and assessment of OMI capability for retrieving UVIs was also performed. An overestimation of the OMI erythemal product by 3–6\% and 4–8\% with respect to ground measurements is observed when examining overpass and noontime estimates respectively. The comparisons revealed a relatively small solar zenith angle dependence, with the OMI data showing a slight dependence on aerosol load, especially at high aerosol optical depth values. A mean underestimation of 2\% in OMI total ozone columns under cloud-free conditions was found to lead to an overestimation in OMI erythemal doses of 1–5\%.While OMI overestimated the erythemal dose rates over the range of cloudiness conditions examined, its UVIs were found to be reliable for the purpose of characterizing the ambient UV radiation impact.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on the assessment of surface solar radiation (SSR) based on operational neural network (NN) and multi-regression function (MRF) modelling techniques that produce instantaneous (in less than 1\&thinsp;min) outputs. Using real-time cloud and aerosol optical properties inputs from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on board the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), respectively, these models are capable of calculating SSR in high resolution (1\&thinsp;nm, 0.05∘, 15\&thinsp;min) that can be used for spectrally integrated irradiance maps, databases and various applications related to energy exploitation. The real-time models are validated against ground-based measurements of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) in a temporal range varying from 15\&thinsp;min to monthly means, while a sensitivity analysis of the cloud and aerosol effects on SSR is performed to ensure reliability under different sky and climatological conditions. The simulated outputs, compared to their common training dataset created by the radiative transfer model (RTM) libRadtran, showed median error values in the range −15 to 15\&thinsp;\% for the NN that produces spectral irradiances (NNS), 5–6\&thinsp;\% underestimation for the integrated NN and close to zero errors for the MRF technique. The verification against BSRN revealed that the real-time calculation uncertainty ranges from −100 to 40 and −20 to 20\&thinsp;W\&thinsp;m−2, for the 15\&thinsp;min and monthly mean global horizontal irradiance (GHI) averages, respectively, while the accuracy of the input parameters, in terms of aerosol and cloud optical thickness (AOD and COT), and their impact on GHI, was of the order of 10\&thinsp;\% as compared to the ground-based measurements. The proposed system aims to be utilized through studies and real-time applications which are related to solar energy production planning and use.},

In the first stage of model development, \textasciitilde30,000 records of coincident solar UV spectral irradiance measurements from a Norsk Institutt for Luftforskning (NILU)-UV multi-filter radiometer and TOC measurements from a co-located Brewer spectroradiometer are used to train a NN to learn the nonlinear functional relation between the irradiances and TOC. The model is then subjected to sensitivity analysis and validation. Close agreement is obtained (R2=0.94, RMSE=8.21 DU and bias=−0.15 DU relative to the Brewer) for the training data in the correlation of NN estimates on Brewer derived TOC with 95\% of the coincident data differing by less than 13 DU. In the second stage of development, a long time series (≥1 million records) of high frequency (\textasciitilde1min) NILU-UV ground-based measurements are presented as inputs to the NN model to generate high frequency TOC estimates. The advantage of the NN model is that it is not site dependent and is applicable to any NILU input data lying within the range of the training data. GOME/ERS-2, SCIAMACHY/Envisat, OMI/Aura and GOME2/MetOp-A TOC records are then used to perform a precise cross-validation analysis and comparison with the NILU TOC estimates over Thessaloniki. All 4 satellite TOC dataset are retrieved using the GOME Direct Fitting algorithm, version 3 (GODFIT\_v3), for reasons of consistency. The NILU TOC estimates within ±30min of the overpass times agree well with the satellite TOC retrievals with coefficient of determination in the range 0.88≤R2≤0.90 for all sky conditions and 0.95≤R2≤0.96 for clear sky conditions. The mean fractional differences are found to be −0.67\%±2.15\%, −1.44\%±2.25\%, −2.09\%±2.06\% and −0.85\%±2.19\% for GOME, SCIAMACHY, OMI and GOME2 respectively for the clear sky cases. The near constant standard deviation (\textasciitilde±2.2\%) across the array of sensors testifies directly to the stability of both the GODFIT\_v3 algorithm and the NN model for providing coherent and robust TOC records. Furthermore, the high Pearson product moment correlation coefficients (0.94\textlessR\textless0.98) testify to the strength of the linear relationship between the satellite algorithm retrievals of TOC and ground-based estimates, while biases of less than 5 DU suggest that systematic errors are low. This novel methodology contributes to the ongoing assessment of the quality and consistency of ground and space-based measurements of total ozone columns.},

  abstract = {This study assesses the impact of dust on surface solar radiation focussing on an extreme dust event. For this purpose, we exploited the synergy of AERONET measurements and passive and active satellite remote sensing (MODIS and CALIPSO) observations, in conjunction with radiative transfer model (RTM) and chemical transport model (CTM) simulations and the 1-day forecasts from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). The area of interest is the eastern Mediterranean where anomalously high aerosol loads were recorded between 30 January and 3 February 2015. The intensity of the event was extremely high, with aerosol optical depth (AOD) reaching 3.5, and optical/microphysical properties suggesting aged dust. RTM and CTM simulations were able to quantify the extent of dust impact on surface irradiances and reveal substantial reduction in solar energy exploitation capacity of PV and CSP installations under this high aerosol load. We found that such an extreme dust event can result in Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) attenuation by as much as 40–50 \% and a much stronger Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) decrease (80–90 \%), while spectrally this attenuation is distributed to 37 \% in the UV region, 33 \% in the visible and around 30 \% in the infrared. CAMS forecasts provided a reliable available energy assessment (accuracy within 10 \% of that obtained from MODIS). Spatially, the dust plume resulted in a zonally averaged reduction of GHI and DNI of the order of 150 W m−2 in southern Greece, and a mean increase of 20 W m−2 in the northern Greece as a result of lower AOD values combined with local atmospheric processes. This analysis of a real-world scenario contributes to the understanding and quantification of the impact range of high aerosol loads on solar energy and the potential for forecasting power generation failures at sunshine-privileged locations where solar power plants exist, are under construction or are being planned.},

  abstract = {This study aims to cross-validate ground-based and satellite-based models of three photobiological UV effective dose products: the Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage (CIE) erythemal UV, the production of vitamin D in the skin, and DNA damage, using high-temporal-resolution surface-based measurements of solar UV spectral irradiances from a synergy of instruments and models. The satellite-based Tropospheric Emission Monitoring Internet Service (TEMIS; version 1.4) UV daily dose data products were evaluated over the period 2009 to 2014 with ground-based data from a Norsk Institutt for Luftforskning (NILU)-UV multifilter radiometer located at the northern midlatitude super-site of the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (LAP/AUTh), in Greece. For the NILU-UV effective dose rates retrieval algorithm, a neural network (NN) was trained to learn the nonlinear functional relation between NILU-UV irradiances and collocated Brewer-based photobiological effective dose products. Then the algorithm was subjected to sensitivity analysis and validation. The correlation of the NN estimates with target outputs was high (r = 0. 988 to 0.990) and with a very low bias (0.000 to 0.011 in absolute units) proving the robustness of the NN algorithm. For further evaluation of the NILU NN-derived products, retrievals of the vitamin D and DNA-damage effective doses from a collocated Yankee Environmental Systems (YES) UVB-1 pyranometer were used. For cloud-free days, differences in the derived UV doses are better than 2 \% for all UV dose products, revealing the reference quality of the ground-based UV doses at Thessaloniki from the NILU-UV NN retrievals. The TEMIS UV doses used in this study are derived from ozone measurements by the SCIAMACHY/Envisat and GOME2/MetOp-A satellite instruments, over the European domain in combination with SEVIRI/Meteosat-based diurnal cycle of the cloud cover fraction per 0. 5° × 0. 5° (lat × long) grid cells. TEMIS UV doses were found to be ∼\&thinsp;12.5 \% higher than the NILU NN estimates but, despite the presence of a visually apparent seasonal pattern, the R2 values were found to be robustly high and equal to 0.92\&ndash;0.93 for 1588 all-sky coincidences. These results significantly improve when limiting the dataset to cloud-free days with differences of 0.57 \% for the erythemal doses, 1.22 \% for the vitamin D doses, and 1.18 \% for the DNA-damage doses, with standard deviations of the order of 11\&ndash;13 \%. The improvement of the comparative statistics under cloud-free cases further testifies to the importance of the appropriate consideration of the contribution of clouds in the UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface. For the urban area of Thessaloniki, with highly variable aerosol, the weakness of the implicit aerosol information introduced to the TEMIS UV dose algorithm was revealed by comparison of the datasets to aerosol optical depths at 340 nm as reported by a collocated CIMEL sun photometer, operating in Thessaloniki at LAP/AUTh as part of the NASA Aerosol Robotic Network.},

  abstract = {China, with its rapid economic growth and immense exporting power, has been the focus of many studies during this previous decade quantifying its increasing emissions contribution to the Earth's atmosphere. With a population slowly shifting towards enlarged power and purchasing needs, the ceaseless inauguration of new power plants, smelters, refineries and industrial parks leads infallibly to increases in sulphur dioxide, SO2, emissions. The recent capability of next generation algorithms as well as new space-borne instruments to detect anthropogenic SO2 loads has enabled a fast advancement in this field. In the following work, algorithms providing total SO2 columns over China based on SCIAMACHY/Envisat, OMI/Aura and GOME2/MetopA observations are presented. The need for post-processing and gridding of the SO2 fields is further revealed in this work, following the path of previous publications. Further, it is demonstrated that the usage of appropriate statistical tools permits studying parts of the datasets typically excluded, such as the winter months loads. Focusing on actual point sources, such as megacities and known power plant locations, instead of entire provinces, monthly mean time series have been examined in detail. The sharp decline in SO2 emissions in more than 90\%–95\% of the locations studied confirms the recent implementation of government desulphurisation legislation; however, locations with increases, even for the previous five years, are also identified. These belong to provinces with emerging economies which are in haste to install power plants and are possibly viewed leniently by the authorities, in favour of growth. The SO2 load seasonality has also been examined in detail with a novel mathematical tool, with 70\% of the point sources having a statistically significant annual cycle with highs in winter and lows in summer, following the heating requirements of the Chinese population.},

Our study took place at stations of the Greek UV network (UVNET) and the Hellenic solar energy network (HNSE) with measurements from NILU-UV multi-filter radiometers and CM pyranometers, chosen due to their long (≈1M record/site) high temporal resolution (≈1min) record that captures a broad range of atmospheric environments and cloudiness conditions. The uncertainty of the PAR measurements is quantified to be ±6.5\% while the uncertainty involved in GHI measurements is up to ≈±7\% according to the manufacturer. We show how multi-linear regression and nonlinear neural network (NN) models, trained at a calibration site (Thessaloniki) can be made generic provided that the input–output time series are processed with multi-channel singular spectrum analysis (M-SSA). Without M-SSA, both linear and nonlinear models perform well only locally. M-SSA with 50 time-lags is found to be sufficient for identification of trend, periodic and noise components in aerosol, cloud parameters and irradiance, and to construct regularized noise models of PAR from GHI irradiances. Reconstructed PAR and GHI time series capture ≈95\% of the variance of the cross-validated target measurements and have median absolute percentage errors \textless2\%. The intra-site median absolute error of M-SSA processed models were ≈8.2±1.7W/m2 for PAR and ≈9.2±4.2W/m2 for GHI. When applying the models trained at Thessaloniki to other stations, the average absolute mean bias between the model estimates and measured values was found to be ≈1.2W/m2 for PAR and ≈0.8W/m2 for GHI. For the models, percentage errors are well within the uncertainty of the measurements at all sites. Generic NN models were found to perform marginally better than their linear counterparts.},

Two NN solvers, one for clear sky conditions dominated by aerosol and one for cloudy skies, were trained on a normally-distributed and multiparametric subset of the LUT that spans a very broad class of atmospheric and meteorological conditions as inputs with corresponding high resolution solar irradiance target spectra as outputs. The NN solvers were tested by feeding them with a large (10K record) “off-grid” random subset of the LUT spanning the training data space, and then comparing simulated outputs with target values provided by the LUT. The NN solvers demonstrated a capability to interpolate accurately over the entire multiparametric space. Once trained, the NN solvers allow for high-speed estimation of solar radiation spectra with high spectral resolution (1nm) and for a quantification of the effect of aerosol and cloud optical parameters on the solar radiation budget without the need for a massive database. The cloudy sky NN solver was applied to high spatial resolution (54K pixel) cloud data extracted from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) onboard the geostationary Meteosat Second Generation 3 (MSG3) satellite and demonstrated that coherent maps of spectrally-integrated global horizontal irradiance at this resolution can be produced on the order of 1min.},

What is even less well known are the characteristics of mixtures of aerosol and, in particular, their precise global spatial distribution. Here, cluster analysis is applied to seven years of 3-hourly, gridded 2.5° × 2° aerosol optical depth data from the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model, one of the most-studied global simulations of aerosol type currently available, to construct a spatial partition of the globe into a finite number of aerosol mixtures. The optimal number of aerosol mixtures is obtained with a k-means algorithm with smart seeding in conjunction with a stopping condition based on applying the ‘law of diminishing returns’ to the norm of the Euclidean distance to provide upper and lower bounds on the number of clusters. Each cluster has a distinct composition in terms of the proportion of biomass burning, sulfate, dust and marine (sea salt) aerosol and this leads rather naturally to a taxonomy for labeling aerosol mixtures. In addition, the assignment of primary colors to constituent aerosol types enables true color-mixing and the production of easy-to-interpret maps of their distribution. The mean multiyear global partition as well as partitions deduced on the seasonal timescale are used to extract aerosol robotic network (AERONET) Level 2.0 Version 2 inversion products in each cluster for estimating the values of key optical and microphysical parameters to help characterize aerosol mixtures. On the multiyear timescale, the globe can be spatially partitioned into 10 distinct aerosol mixtures, with only marginally more variability on the seasonal timescale. In the context of the observational constraints and uncertainties associated with AERONET retrievals, bivariate analysis suggests that mixtures dominated by dust and marine aerosol can be detected with reference to their single scattering albedo and Angstrom exponent at visible wavelengths in conjunction with their fine mode fraction and sphericity. Existing multivariate approaches at classification appear to be more ambiguous. The approach presented here provides gridded (1° × 1°) mean compositions of aeorosol mixtures as well as tentative estimates of mean aerosol optical and microphysical parameters in planetary regions where AERONET sites do not yet exist. Spreadsheets of gridded cluster indices for multiyear and seasonal partitions are provided to facililate further study of the global distribution of aerosol mixtures and possibly for the selection of new AERONET site locations.},

  abstract = {In order to exploit the full-earth viewing potential of satellite instruments to globally characterise aerosols, new algorithms are required to deduce key microphysical parameters like the particle size distribution and optical parameters associated with scattering and absorption from space remote sensing data. Here, a methodology based on neural networks is developed to retrieve such parameters from satellite inputs and to validate them with ground-based remote sensing data. For key combinations of input variables available from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) and the Ozone Measuring Instrument (OMI) Level 3 data sets, a grid of 100 feed-forward neural network architectures is produced, each having a different number of neurons and training proportion. The networks are trained with principal components accounting for 98\% of the variance of the inputs together with principal components formed from 38 AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) Level 2.0 (Version 2) retrieved parameters as outputs. Daily averaged, co-located and synchronous data drawn from a cluster of AERONET sites centred on the peak of dust extinction in Northern Africa is used for network training and validation, and the optimal network architecture for each input parameter combination is identified with reference to the lowest mean squared error. The trained networks are then fed with unseen data at the coastal dust site Dakar to test their simulation performance. A neural network (NN), trained with co-located and synchronous satellite inputs comprising three aerosol optical depth measurements at 470, 550 and 660 nm, plus the columnar water vapour (from MODIS) and the modelled absorption aerosol optical depth at 500 nm (from OMI), was able to simultaneously retrieve the daily averaged size distribution, the coarse mode volume, the imaginary part of the complex refractive index, and the spectral single scattering albedo – with moderate precision: correlation coefficients in the range 0.368 ≤ R ≤ 0.514. The network failed to recover the spectral behaviour of the real part of the complex refractive index. This new methodological approach appears to offer some potential for moderately accurate daily retrieval of the total volume concentration of the coarse mode of aerosol at the Saharan dust peak in the area of Northern Africa.},

During this period, direct-sun AOD retrievals from both instruments exhibited small differences in the range 0.01–0.02. The AODs measured with CIMEL and PFR instruments were inverted to retrieve particle microphysical properties using the linear estimation (LE) technique. For low aerosol loads (AOD 0.4), measurements of the effective radius by the PFR are consistently 20 \% lower than CIMEL for both direct-sun and inversion data. Volume concentrations at low aerosol loads from the PFR are up to 80\% higher than the CIMEL for direct-sun data but are up to 20\% lower when derived from inversion data under these same conditions. At higher loads, the percentage difference in volume concentrations from the PFR and CIMEL is systematically negative, with inversion data predicting differences 30\% lower than those obtained from direct-sun data. An assessment of the effect of errors in the AOD retrieval on the estimation of PFR bulk parameters was performed and demonstrates that it is possible to estimate the particle volume concentration and effective radius with an uncertainty \textless 65\% when AOD \textless 0.2 and when input errors are as high as 10\%.},

  abstract = {To date, size distributions obtained from the aerosol robotic network (AERONET) have been fit with bi-lognormals defined by six secondary microphysical parameters: the volume concentration, effective radius, and the variance of fine and coarse particle modes. However, since the total integrated volume concentration is easily calculated and can be used as an accurate constraint, the problem of fitting the size distribution can be reduced to that of deducing a single free parameter – the mode separation point. We present a method for determining the mode separation point for equivalent-volume bi-lognormal distributions based on optimization of the root mean squared error and the coefficient of determination. The extracted secondary parameters are compared with those provided by AERONET's Level 2.0 Version 2 inversion algorithm for a set of benchmark dominant aerosol types, including desert dust, biomass burning aerosol, urban sulphate and sea salt. The total volume concentration constraint is then also lifted by performing multi-modal fits to the size distribution using nested Gaussian mixture models, and a method is presented for automating the selection of the optimal number of modes using a stopping condition based on Fisher statistics and via the application of statistical hypothesis testing. It is found that the method for optimizing the location of the mode separation point is independent of the shape of the aerosol volume size distribution (AVSD), does not require the existence of a local minimum in the size interval 0.439 μm \&le; r \&le; 0.992 μm, and shows some potential for optimizing the bi-lognormal fitting procedure used by AERONET particularly in the case of desert dust aerosol. The AVSD of impure marine aerosol is found to require three modes. In this particular case, bi-lognormals fail to recover key features of the AVSD. Fitting the AVSD more generally with multi-modal models allows automatic detection of a statistically significant number of aerosol modes, is applicable to a very diverse range of aerosol types, and gives access to the secondary microphysical parameters of additional modes currently not available from bi-lognormal fitting methods.},

First, a universal, spatially constant lidar ratio of 58 sr instead of 40 sr is applied to individual Level 2 dust-related backscatter products. The resulting aerosol optical depths show an improvement compared with synchronous and collocated AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) measurements. An absolute bias of the order of −0.03 has been found, improving on the statistically significant biases of the order of −0.10 reported in the literature for the original CALIPSO product. When compared with the MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) collocated aerosol optical depth (AOD) product, the CALIPSO negative bias is even less for the lidar ratio of 58 sr. After introducing the new lidar ratio for the domain studied, we examine potential improvements to the climatological CALIPSO Level 3 extinction product: (1) by introducing a new methodology for the calculation of pure dust extinction from dust mixtures and (2) by applying an averaging scheme that includes zero extinction values for the nondust aerosol types detected. The scheme is applied at a horizontal spatial resolution of 1° × 1° for ease of comparison with the instantaneous and collocated dust extinction profiles simulated by the BSC-DREAM8b dust model. Comparisons show that the extinction profiles retrieved with the proposed methodology reproduce the well-known model biases per subregion examined. The very good agreement of the proposed CALIPSO extinction product with respect to AERONET, MODIS and the BSC-DREAM8b dust model makes this dataset an ideal candidate for the provision of an accurate and robust multiyear dust climatology over northern Africa and Europe.},

  abstract = {This tutorial presents a review of the analytical approach to obtain exact solutions for the populations of n-level ions, and summarizes the ideas behind detailed balance and the statistical physics of collisionally-excited ions. Seaton’s analytical solution for the populations of the 3-level ion has been supplanted by matrix methods such as the master equation approach, which are now central to astronomy since there is a need to maintain a parity between improvements in quantum-mechanically calculated values for collision strengths and transition probabilities on the one hand, and three-dimensional (3D) photoionization codes used by astrophysicists for producing nebular diagnostics on the other. We show that the analytical method of solution to the problem using matrices and symbolic mathematics is straightforward, and we illustrate through theoretical, numerical, and empirical checks the validity of its results. First, we recast the equations of thermal statistical equilibrium for the energy level populations of collisionally-excited ions in the form of a well-defined matrix equation. We then show how symbolic mathematics is efficient in the inversion of equations and is able to provide the exact analytical solutions for the sought-after level populations. We present the matrices for the 5-level ion as an example of how to extend the exact solution for the 3-level ion to illustrate the general technique. We then show how the analytical results faithfully reduce to the Seaton solution when appropriate limits are taken. Spectrophotometric observations of a real ionized gas (the planetary nebula A39) are then used to obtain empirical values of forbidden line ratios and level populations for the 5-level [O III] ion. These values are compared with: (1) a best-fit 3D Monte Carlo photoionization model, and (2) the exact solution for the 5-level ion, using the symbolic mathematics approach, the exact Seaton 3-level ion solution, and a numerical approximation for the 5-level ion. It is shown that in every case, the analytical solution agrees with results obtained using observed nebular conditions to within the standard error. We provide a MATLAB code that can be adapted and tailored by astrophysicists to calculations of other n-level ions.},

  abstract = {Absorption of waves propagating across an inhomogenous magnetic field is of crucial importance for cyclotron resonance heating. When the Larmor radius of the resonant particles is small compared to the wavelength then the propagation is described by differential equations, a comparatively simple method for obtaining which has recently been given by Cairns et al. [Phys. Fluids B 3, 2953 (1991)]. In a fusion plasma there may, however, be a significant population of ions whose Larmor radius is not small compared to the wavelength. In this case the system is described by integro‐differential equations, reflecting the fact that the plasma response at a given position is determined by the wave field over a region of width of the order of the Larmor radius. The simplified method referred to above is adapted to this case and used to obtain various forms of the equations. Methods of simplifying the equations while still retaining information from the non‐local response, are discussed and some illustrated numerical results presented.},

  abstract = {An outstanding problem in the field of nuclear fusion research is the precise mechanism by which a hot, magnetically inhomogeneous plasma is heated when illuminated by a constant beam of small amplitude radio waves matched in frequency to harmonics of the ion Larmor frequency. An accurate model must include microscopic dynamics and inevitably a kinetic theory is required. Highly energetic ions (\textgreater 1MeV) born from fusion reactions or powered by gyroresonance have large Larmor radii (\textgreater 10cm) which are comparable in size to the wavelength of the incident radiation. In particular we will focus on fast magnetosonic waves. Exact full wave equations describing a thermal plasma in a weakly inhomogeneous field are presently at least fourth order integro-differential equations (Sauter, 1992). These are computationally taxing. Recently a method was proposed to reduce the problem to a second order integro-differential equation at the expense of information related to the propagation of mode-converted waves (Holt, 1992). We present here a generalisation of the theory to allow for arbitrary velocity-dependent equilibria while at the same time retaining a general functional form for the field profile. We consider the specific case of a bi-Maxwellian plasma immersed in a linearly inhomogenous magnetic field. We find that thermal anisotropy produces resonance localisation when the perpendicular ion temperature is greater than that parallel to the ambient field. A study of the symmetry properties of the conductivity tensor reveals that the Onsager reciprocal relations are obeyed only for an isotropic plasma in an inhomogeneous field. This is a generalisation of the result obtained by Nambu (1995). We present a generalisation of the reduction method to include effects due to changes in wave amplitude. We find that we are able to include the odd-order field derivatives responsible for energy conservation. Our numerical study of fundamental Helium-3 gyroresonance in a majority Deuterium plasma reveals that we have \textgreater 99.9\% energy conservation in all cases. We show that locally-uniform theory can be very inaccurate (≃ 70\% in one case presented in our recent paper, Cairns et al., 1995) particularly for higher energy ions whose non-locality is more extreme. We present a representative sample of results for minority heating and mode conversion heating schemes. We report the appearance of an unexpected cut-off on the low field side of the minority gyroresonance which may have important consequences for antennae presently placed on the outside of Tokamaks.},

  abstract = {Academic papers, like genes, code for ideas or technological innovations that structure and transform the scientific organism and consequently the society at large. Genes are subject to the process of natural selection which ensures that only the fittest survive and contribute to the phenotype of the organism. The process of selection of academic papers, however, is far from natural. Commercial for-profit publishing houses have taken control over the evaluation and access to scientific information with serious consequences for the dissemination and advancement of knowledge. Academic authors and librarians are reacting by developing an alternative publishing system based on free-access journals and self-archiving in institutional repositories and global disciplinary libraries. Despite the emergence of such trends, the journal monopoly, rather than the scientific community, is still in control of selecting papers and setting academic standards. Here we propose a dynamical and transparent peer review process, which we believe will accelerate the transition to a fully open and free-for-all science that will allow the natural selection of the fittest ideas.},

  abstract = {Machine learning is a domain highly influenced by the rapid evolution of cloud computing and has reached a maturity point where a plethora of data processing capabilities is now widely available. The aim of the present study is to investigate the potential for building a common platform to support direct end-user application of machine learning algorithms across diverse scientific areas, emphasizing not only the suitability of appropriate tools, but also how results can be disseminated and utilized in a shared data environment. Three case studies are presented: i) quality evaluation metrics for tomographic image reconstruction in positron emission tomography (PET), ii) health impacts of surface UV radiation and iii) demographic determinants that influence the perception of fraud and corruption incidents within different industry sectors. Tests showed that commercially available cloud resources are over-sufficient to consolidate results from a variety of teams and applications and are able to contribute to the build-up of a valuable shared knowledge repository. The cloud service platform exploits machine learning models and helps automate the training and prediction process. The suggested approach makes optimization more efficient and supports the transition to a more sustainable global information environment by breaking knowledge silos.},

  abstract = {Internationality as a concept is being applied ambiguously, particularly in the world of academic journal publication. Although different criteria are used by scientometrists in order to measure internationality and to supplement its minimal literal meaning, the present study suggests that no single criterion alone is sufficient. This paper surveys, critically-assesses and extends the existing measures of internationality in the context of academic publishing and identifies those criteria that are most clearly resolved and amenable to quantitative analysis. When applied, however, to a case study of four thematically-connected journals from the field of Health and Clinical Psychology using descriptive statistics and the Gini Coefficient, the measurement of internationality using these criteria was found to be ambiguous. We conclude that internationality is best viewed as a mathematically fuzzy entity and that a single measure Internationality Index, constructed from a combination of suitably weighted criteria, is the only way to unambiguously quantify the degree of internationality.},

Its application to heart rate variability (HRV) has proven useful in distinguishing healthy subjects from patients with cardiovascular disease. In this study we examined the effect of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) on the performance of DFA applied to HRV. Predictions based on a mathematical model were compared with those obtained from a sample of 14 normal subjects at three breathing frequencies: 0.1Hz, 0.2Hz and 0.25Hz. Results revealed that: (1) the periodical properties of RSA produce a change of the correlation exponent in HRV at a scale corresponding to the respiratory period, (2) the short-term DFA exponent is significantly reduced when breathing frequency rises from 0.1Hz to 0.2Hz. These findings raise important methodological questions regarding the application of fractal measures to short-term HRV.},
